·### Overview

This workshop is designed to be run on your laptop.
First, you will need to download the data we use in the workshop.
Then, you need to install some software.
After following the instructions on this
page, you should have everything you need to participate fully in the workshop!

### Data

[The data required is contained in this link to a `.zip` file]({{sire.url}}/data/data.zip)

This will automatically download all of the files to your default download directory as a single compressed
(`.zip`) file. To expand this file, double click the folder icon in your file navigator application (for Macs, this is the Finder application).

The data for this lesson is a part of the Data Carpentry Humanities workshop. It is a teaching version of the [EEBO](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebogroup/)/TCP metadata catalogue. The data in this lesson is a subset of the teaching version that has been intentionally ‘messed up’ for this lesson.
