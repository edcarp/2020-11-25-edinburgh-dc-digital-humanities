Remove the third paragraph if the workshop will teach Python
using something other than the Jupyter Notebook. Details at

  <h3>Python</h3>
  <p>
    We will teach Python using the Jupyter Notebook, a programming environment that runs in a web browser.
    For Jupyter Notebook we will be using the University of Edinburgh's Noteable service. You can <a href="https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login">Login to Noteable Directly via EASE</a>.
    For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).
