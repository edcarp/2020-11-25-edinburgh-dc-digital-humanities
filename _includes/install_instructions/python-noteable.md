Remove the third paragraph if the workshop will teach Python
using something other than the Jupyter Notebook. Details at

### Python

* We will teach Python using the Jupyter Notebook, a programming environment that runs in a web browser.
* For Jupyter Notebook we will be using the University of Edinburgh's Noteable service. You can [Login to Noteable Directly via EASE](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login)
* For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).
